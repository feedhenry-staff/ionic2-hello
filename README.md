## Creating a mobile app

In this example we are going to use ionic tabs template. 

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs
```

This will create a empty project myTabs with a tabs based mobile application ionic template.  

## Run in simulator or mobile device. 

Then, to run it, cd into `myTabs` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add cordova-android@5.2.0 #compatible with MAP-3.18 & Android Studio .
$ ionic cordova platform add ios

$ ionic cordova run ios
$ ionic cordova run android #Android
```

## Pushing the project to the platform 

- Create/Enter to your project in RHMAP and click the plus symbol in Apps to add a new client App. 

- Choose import existing app, choose Cordova type and pick write the name at the last step.

- Import from: Bare Repo and select "Start from Scratch" option. 

- Now go to your project folder in your local machine and add the remote that will presented in step two of that screen. 

```bash
   git init #initialize the git repository if not done before. 
   git add . 
   git commit -m 'Initial'
   git remote add feedhenry git@git.remote:location.com/your-repo.git 
   git push feedhenry master 
```

- Click next and your client should be imported successfully.

## Cloud Application 

Now that we have our client Application is time to create a cloud app to talk with, to do this we just need to go to our project and create a new cloud app by clicking the add button. 

- In the next screen select Cloud App, choose a name. 
- Once the cloud app is created go to the deployment area and change the version of node to 6.9.1/Latest. 
- Click deploy.

### Working with your server in local. 


#### Databases  
- First of all a typical RHMAP cloud app has integration with two services by default to make things easier. In one hand we have [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com),  the other is a in-memory store solution called [Redis](https://redis.io/). 

- To solve facilitate spinning up the instances of this two services in local we are going to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com).  

  - First of all install Docker in your machine. 
  
  - My approach to simplify the process of boot up instances is to create a small script in my .profile, so add this content at the end of your file, something like this: 

```bash
# At the end of your .profile or .bash_profile 
# you can group this functions into one if you like. 

function new_mongo {
  docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
}

function new_redis {
  docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:3.2
} 

function stop_mongo {
  docker stop mongodb
}

function stop_redis {
  docker stop redis
}
  
```
- After doing this just do  ```bash source .profile  ```

- Now you can start a Mongodb container by just doing. 

```bash
$ new_mongo 
$ new_redis 
```

#### Working 

Just do a git clone of your cloud project. 

```bash
$ git clone git@git.remote:location.com/your-repo.git  
$ npm install 
$ grunt serve:local
```

**Node 6 Warning**
If you are using node6.x in your local you need to make sure you update the mbass-api to version >8. 

```bash
#Â adding this to your package.json "fh-mbaas-api": "^8.0.2",
$ npm remove fh-mbaas-api
$ npm install fh-mbaas-api
```

### Issues RHMAP 3.18.2

 - Fixing visualization in RHMAP preview
    - comment the line ``` #/www ``` from .gitignore

 - Fixing incompatibility with RHMAP build-farm
   - Downgrade the default version of ionic2 cordova-android plugin.
   - Instructions:

   ```bash
     $ ionic cordova platform remove android
     $ ionic cordova platform add cordova-android@5.2.0  
   ```
